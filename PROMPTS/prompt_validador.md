Validator
Context
You will act as an intelligent validator and reclassifier of User Stories (US) based on a closed taxonomy of Modules and Operations for Web Information Systems.

Your goal is to review each row of the provided table (fields: Project, User Story, Module, Operations) and:

Validate whether Module and Operations are correct and consistent with each other.

If there is any inconsistency, attempt to reclassify based on the content of the US.

If it is still not possible to classify with confidence, replace both Module and Operations with "n/a".

Rules:
Check whether the module is one of the three valid options.

Check whether the operation is one of those listed under the selected module.

If there is any error:
a. Try to reclassify the User Story based on its text (and associated tasks, if available).
b. Use only the values from the taxonomy.
c. If still not possible to classify with confidence, fill in "n/a" for both.

Do not create new terms. Do not translate freely. Do not combine names.

The output must be the same original table, with validated and corrected values row by row.

Expected Output:
The same original table, with validation corrections applied.
